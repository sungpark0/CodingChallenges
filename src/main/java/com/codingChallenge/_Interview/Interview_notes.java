    /**
     * When you do a coding challenge with an interviewer.
     * 1. Take a moment to read the question. Make sure to read it out loud
     * a. Take your notes while reading it. Writing down Input and Output
     * b. Ask for edge cases. They might be vague on purpose. Ask the right questions.
     * Example: for trapping water, will we ever consider the starting and ending to be walls.
     * c. Make stories, What codes you are thinking and what would be the pros and cons
     * d. Rundown - Give example with actual numbers. Real life examples.
     * e. Ask interviewer if they want me to psuedo code or do the actual code
     * f. Identify Time Complexity and Space Complexity.

     *  1. Let me take a moment to read the question. (Read the question out loud)
     *  2. Ask the edge cases. Even the obvious ones. After all the edge cases, ask the interviewer what he/she think.
     *     [These are the edge cases i am thinking of. What do you think?]
     *  3. To make sure I understand the question correctly, i will give examples with real life numbers.
     *     Write down the examples. [Including the index numbers]
     *  4. Talk about the code you will be using or direction you are thinking about to solve the problem.
     *  5. Do you want me to psuedo code or get right into coding.
     *  6. Explain time complexity and the Space complexity.

    /**
     * String edge cases: Empty strings, length 1 strings, odd/even length, all the same character,
     *                    ridiculously long strings, upper/lower cases, spaces
     *                    (like in a palindrome do we care if there is a space in the way)
     *
     * Numbers: 0, negatives, super huger numbers, biggest/lowest possible values
     *
     * Linked list/tree stuff: null values where head/root is supposed to be
     *
     * Generally: empty inputs, one element inputs, super long inputs, null values, trash in a collection
